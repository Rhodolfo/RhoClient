This sbt build has one main project, the http client wrapper RhoClient.
RhoClient is a wrapper for HttpComponents from Apache.

To initialize the client:
> import com.rho.client.RhoClient
> val client = new RhoClient(scheme="https",host="www.example.com")

Perform a simple GET:
> val string = client.doGET(Map("par"->"test"))
would do a GET to https://www.example.com?par=test, string has the response.

Another GET example:
> val string = client.doGET(Map("par1"->"test1","par2"->"test2"),"/dir/other")
would do a GET to https://www.example.com/dir/other?par1=test1&par2=test2

POST example: 
> val string = client.doPOST(Map("par"->"test","bar"->"rest"),Map(),"/dir")
would perform a POST to https://www.example.com/dir with the parameters par=test and bar=rest

Look inside src/README for a more complete list of methods and attributes of the RhoClient class.
Look inside demos/src for some more examples.
